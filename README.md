# Fate Grand Order API Site

My name is Fahmi Sardar, I'm currently studying at the University of Calgary

I've made this site to similar to the Fate Grand Order fandom wiki site
https://fategrandorder.fandom.com/wiki/Servant_List
as it's a site I use often and cherish.

This site is also mainly for me to apply the things I have learnt in my software engineering degree. The main purpose of this site is to help me learn the ins and outs of React along with doing fetch requests using an API

The API I am using for this project is the API provided by Atlus Academy
